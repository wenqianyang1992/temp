## ℹ️️ Introduction

This skeleton repository was built to serve as a starting point for building a java project that implements Hexagonal Architecture + Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

As a example I included an API that covers all the layers to show the implementation in each of them.

## 🔧️ Dependencies

 - [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
 - [Spring Boot 3.2.0](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#overview)
 - [Maven 3.9.4](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.4/release-notes.html)

## 🚀 How to Start
1. Create your repository from this [java-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton](https://github.com/lionelgt/java-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton) repository. [Follow these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). 
2. Clone your repository: `git clone https://github.com/:your-user/:your-repository-name`. 
3. Execute this to build jar:  `mvn clean package`
4. Execute this to build image: `docker build -t java-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .`
5. Execute this to run the container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 java-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
6. In order to check everything is OK : `curl 'localhost:8080/api/git-repository'`
7. Start developing!
